# BookRecommender

## next steps:

### by Friday (4/1()
- use classes
- avoid global vars

### by Sunday (4/21)
- book recommendation part
- Hosted online


rec part steps:

in book manager add listener for when recommend is pressed 
    check for errors like no books selected or none there.
    send call to book service to get these, then add them

so i need to make a book service function to get recommendations

the final part will be to add saving and deleting to the recommended books,
show loading when recommend is pressed.
have the recommended Books section not show up unless there is at least one recommended book already present.
    this could be done with like .visible class or soemthing

estimated time to complete is like 4 hours cause i also need to host it.
